Got it! Let’s refine your `README.md` to reflect that the project is entirely built within **Next.js** and doesn’t rely on Node.js explicitly. Here's a more comprehensive and polished version of your `README.md`:

# AI Chat Application

This is an **AI Chat Application** built with **Next.js**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**. The application allows users to interact with an AI-powered chatbot, leveraging **OpenAI's API** to generate intelligent and context-aware responses. It provides a seamless and interactive chat experience, making it ideal for various use cases such as customer support, personal assistants, or educational tools.

---

## Features

- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Utilizes OpenAI's API to generate human-like responses.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Users can chat with the AI in real-time.
- **Database Integration**: Uses PostgreSQL with Prisma for data persistence and management.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with modern UI components and TailwindCSS for a sleek and responsive interface.
- **Theming Support**: Supports light and dark themes using `next-themes`.
- **Markdown Support**: Renders chat messages with Markdown formatting using `react-markdown`.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: Required to run the PostgreSQL database in a container.
- **Docker Compose**: Used to manage multi-container Docker applications.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-chat-app.git
cd ai-chat-app
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL="youre-postgres-url"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
NODE_ENV="development"
```

- Replace `user` and `password` with your PostgreSQL credentials.
- Replace `your-openai-api-key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### 3. Start the PostgreSQL Database with Docker

Run the following command to start the PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Run Database Migrations

Use Prisma to apply database migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### 6. Start the Development Server

Run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
